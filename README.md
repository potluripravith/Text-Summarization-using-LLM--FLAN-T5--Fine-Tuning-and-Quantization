# FLAN-T5 Fine-Tuning and Quantization for Text Summarization

### Overview
This project involves fine-tuning the FLAN-T5 model for text summarization using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) and quantization (8-bit optimization). Additionally, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is implemented using ChromaDB to enhance summaries with relevant context.
